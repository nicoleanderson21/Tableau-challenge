In order to work with the data provided in Tableau for the entire 2023 year, I had to take random samples (n=100000) from each  month's csv and combine them into one large csv. This file was too large to upload to my repository. The code in which I cleaned up and organized the data is located in "Data_Cleanup.ipynb".
